"""
Submission Agent Worker
=======================

The worker is a `Celery <https://celeryproject.org>`_ application that scales
horizontally to run :class:`.Process` instances dispatched by the consumer.
Processes are divided into smaller steps that are run in series. Keeping steps
small makes the overall process more fault-tolerant; if a step fails for some
reason (e.g. worker crashes, meteor strike), it can be retried without
discarding expensive results from previous steps.
